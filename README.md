## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

This website was created using only HTML and CSS. The layout of this site uses flexbox and uses relative length units for the font-sizes and images. With the use of media queries this site is responsive and works on different viewport sizes.

## Optimizations:

I would love to go back and make the responsiveness of this site smoother and experiment using CSS functions like max(), min() and clamp(). I also would like to improve the design of the website.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to work with relative units, media queries and flexbox to create a responsive website. I also learned how to work with external fonts by importing them via CSS. Overall, I am happy with how this site turned out and aim to learn more about responsive web design.
